Description: Code that supports that use of sircovid for our regular
    workflows (weekly SPI-M analyses, medium term projections) and
    forward simulation. Unlike 'sircovid', this package is intended to
    be more rapidly iterated, contains no compiled code, and will be
    significantly less tested because it must bend around
    ever-changing data and requirements for plotting/analysis.
